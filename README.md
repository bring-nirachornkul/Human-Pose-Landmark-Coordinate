# Human-Pose-Landmark-Coordinate

This project started with extract the landmark from the human pose, and the find the coordinate of each landmarks. 

In addition, this is a modified version that remove unnecessary landmarks, such as face, hands, and feet. We need to focus only the arms, legs, and body, in order to reclipate the human pose into 3D form as avatar.


This project was based on mediapipes model which has 33 landmarks on human body.
